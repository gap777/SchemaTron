### FAST SCHEMATRON FOR .NET
Are you a .NET developer who needs to validate XML files against schematron specs? 
Are you tired of having to carry around with you Saxon DLLs which wrap Java bytecode?
Do you need greater performance than you can get launching a separate process each time you want to check an XML file against the schematron rules to which it must conform?

Then this is the project for you!

### XPATH2
We started this with an excellent ISO schematron authored by the XRouter project in C# (Xpath1 only). 
Then, we added in a lightweight .NET library for XPATH2 support. 

### Authors and Contributors
We are grateful to Bohumir Zámecník @bzamecnik and the XRouter team for the ISO Schematron to start with.
Semyon Chertkov @semyon was gracious enough to support work for the XPath2 only branch.
